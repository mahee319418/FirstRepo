hi this is for test folder
good to see you raju

--soft
Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to <commit>, just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed files "Changes to be committed", as git status would put it.

--mixed
Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated. This is the default action.

If -N is specified, removed paths are marked as intent-to-add (see git-add(1)).

--hard
Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded.
